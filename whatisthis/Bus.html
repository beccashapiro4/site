<h2>BUS</h2>
    <p>&quot;So,&quot; he says, &quot;this is it.&quot;</p><p>Lou runs her hand over the back of a seat. &quot;Does it start?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You mean like...the engine?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah like. can you drive it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No...&quot; scratches the back of his head.</p><p>&quot;Oh.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I mean--not yet.&quot;</p><p>Lou walks up and down, from first seat to last. At the front she imagines her first day of school, excited and scared, sitting next to Tommy Thompson, who had a lollipop stuck to his backpack but she didn't want to be the one to spoil it.</p><p>&quot;I'm working on getting it going. Up and running I mean. In the evenings, after work, I come here. Work on the engine.&quot;</p><p>At the back she imagines fifth grade, being cool, shooting gumballs at the backs of the fourth graders heads, playing cards with Harry and betting real money. The time she stole Harry's pet lizard and had him run under all the seats. </p><p>&quot;I've been teaching myself, so it's slow. But I think...in a couple weeks, she'll be up and running.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And then what?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot; He's sitting in the driver's seat.</p><p>&quot;You gonna go somewhere?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;With the bus.&quot;</p>
    <p>"Drive?"</p><p>She nods.</p>
    <p>&quot;Oh. Yeah.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Where?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dunno,&quot; he shrugs. &quot;All over.&quot;</p><p>Lou rolls her eyes.</p><p>&quot;Don't believe me?&quot;</p><p>She shrugs.</p><p>&quot;You don't.&quot;</p><p>Lou gets down on her knees and looks under the seats.</p><p>&quot;I'm not gonna make a list or something. I'm just gonna go one direction and then I'll go another.&quot; He eyes her under the seats. &quot;Whatchu doing?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Lots of gum under here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eugh.&quot;</p><p>Lou straightens up and cleans herself off. She walks towards the entrance.</p><p>He sticks his arm out. &quot;Where you goin?&quot;</p><p>&quot;off.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No.&quot;</p><p>She glares at him. &quot;Let me off, David.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let me off or I'll scream.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do it.&quot;</p><p>He stares at her.</p><p>Lou stares back. </p><p>Silent. </p><p>He removes his arm. &quot;Where you wanna go off to?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Anywhere.&quot;</p><p>He laughs.</p><p>&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>He shakes his head. Walks back to the driver seat.</p><p>&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Go on then.&quot;</p><p>Lou shifts from foot to foot. Looks up and down the bus up and down.</p><p>Lou runs over to him and punches him hard in the arm.</p><p>&quot;Ow!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're not that fucking cool.&quot; She runs off the bus.</p><p>David rubs his arm. Stares after her. Few seconds later he looks up at his reflection in the big bus mirror. He looks small. Not ugly, just small. </p><p></p><p></p>
