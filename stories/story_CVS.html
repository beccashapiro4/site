    <h2> CVS </h2>
    <p>GraceEvelyn reads the receipt one more time but she shakes her head. &quot;No,&quot; she says, &quot;No--see here you charged me for two when there should have been one.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But ma'am you did purchase two.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No--yes--but,&quot; GraceEvelyn shakes her head in utter dismay. &quot;I did yes but, they were on sale, see?&quot; She holds up the bottle of shampoo.</p><p>The cashier who lost her nametag leans in. &quot;Doesn't say anything about a sale.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then why're you showing it to me?&quot;</p><p>GraceEvelyn points behind her. She has perfect posture and a strong, straight arm. &quot;Go check for yourself! And see if it's on sale!&quot;</p><p>The unnamed cashier shrugs. &quot;Want me to refund you the charge?&quot;</p><p>GraceEvelyn drops her arm. &quot;That'll do. Yes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'll have to ring you up again. It'll take a minute.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do what you must.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'll have to pretend to the system that you're making a return.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's okay. I can manage.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It may reflect poorly on your CCS.&quot;</p><p>&quot;My what?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Customer Coupon Status.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Excuse me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It may not. But it may.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why would--why would that reflect poorly--?&quot;</p><p>The unnamed cashier shrugs. &quot;I don't make the rules, ma'am. Do you want to go through with the return?&quot;</p><p>GraceEvelyn shakes her head furiously. She looks at the shampoo. She opens her eyes wide. &quot;Oh!&quot;</p><p>&quot;What's that ma'am?&quot;</p><p>&quot;This isn't even the right scent!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Would you like to make a return?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Will that reflect poorly on my CCS?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It could, ma'am. But maybe not.&quot;</p><p>GraceEvelyn puffs out her chest. &quot;I'll take the risk.&quot; She hands the shampoo to the cashier, who scans it. </p><p>&quot;Would you like to get a replacement bottle?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes...I...would you mind? Waiting?&quot;</p><p>The cashier yawns. &quot;Not at all, ma'am. My shift lasts 10 hours and i have 7 hours remaining. I'll be here, in this spot, for the remainder of that time. I have no problems making the rest of the line wait for you to pick out whichever scent of shampoo you desire. I have no attachment to this corporation or the wellbeing of anybody but the person who is currently at my register. When you are my customer, you are my sole focus--I exist to serve you. I find it significant that my purpose is transient, shifting with each personality who enters my life.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thank you, dear, thank you. I'll be right back. One moment--so sorry for all the trouble. You really are such a doll!&quot;</p><p></p>
    <p class="italic"> inspired by CVS. I hate going to CVS. Every time I enter I want to curl into a ball and roll around, shaking. I hate when they give me their 1000 mile coupons. I want to take all of their coupons and put them in a shredder and record the sound that it makes when it shreds every last one of them forever. </p>
