                  My name's Becca Shapiro.
                  I'm an author/visual artist/amateur comedian in Sunnyside, Queens.
                  I spend most of my time reading or pacing.
                  I own a small but respectable collection of plastic lobsters.
                  I own no real lobsters, nor am I a certified scuba diver.
                  Wonderful news: the shape of the to-go coffee cup works to the advantage of every member of the to-go coffee supply chain (manufactures, suppliers, consumers),
                  despite its unintuitive top-heavy design.
                  Born and raised in Philly, I support the Philadelphia Eagles. I struggle to negotiate my football fanaticism with my general distaste for traumatic brain injuries.
                  I studied Math & Creative Writing at Duke University.
                  I consistently finished last in both Slalom and Giant Slalom USCSA ski races.
                  I moved to New York to build the experimental social media startup
                  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/muze-redesigns-mobile-messaging-as-a-free-form-canvas-for-creativity/"> Muze Collective </a>
                  with a few of my buddies. I spent some time in Prague, writing and reading (and pacing).
                  Iâ€™m currently a barista/bartender at The Center For Fiction in Brooklyn, NY.
                  I've got a few projects in the works, primarily an animated show called 'Freshwater,' which I am scripting, animating, and recording.
                  Other works-in-progress include: a collection of oil paintings called 'Fish & Phalanges' and a prog-rock-EDM-noise-punk band that convenes annually on the first full moon of August.
                  In addition to my creative pursuits, I work as an SAT/ACT tutor, web developer/designer, freelance writer, animator,
                  and just about anything else you'll pay for within reasonable physical and/or legal limits.
