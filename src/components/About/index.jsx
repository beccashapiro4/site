                  Howdy! My name's Becca. Some of my friends call me "Dragon Lord" but you don't have to. Just a suggestion.
                  I'm an author/visual artist/amateur comedian in Sunnyside, Queens.
                  I spend most of my time reading or pacing.
                  I own a small but respectable collection of plastic lobsters. They are not real, and therefore will never die.
                  Born and raised in Philly, I support the Philadelphia Eagles despite my general distaste for traumatic brain injuries.
                  I studied Math & Creative Writing at Duke University. I say "y'all" now.
                  After graduating I moved to New York to build the experimental social media startup
                  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/muze-redesigns-mobile-messaging-as-a-free-form-canvas-for-creativity/"> Muze Collective </a>
                  with a few of my buddies. I coded this website; it only halfway functions.
                  Iâ€™m currently a barista at The Center For Fiction in Brooklyn, NY where I get to say funny stuff and babble about books.
                  I've got a bunch of projects in the works, including an animated show called 'Freshwater' about anthropomorphic fish,
                  a collection of oil paintings called 'Fish & Phalanges,' and a prog-rock-EDM-noise-punk band that convenes annually on the first full moon of August.
                  In addition to my creative pursuits, I work as an SAT/ACT tutor, freelance writer, animator,
                  and just about anything else you'll pay for within reasonable physical and/or legal limits.
                  Please reach out via email or Instagram with any questions or if you wanna say what's up :)
